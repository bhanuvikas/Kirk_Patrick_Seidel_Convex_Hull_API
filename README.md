# Kirk_Patrick_Seidel_Convex_Hull_API
This is an implemetation and visualization of Kirk Patrick Seidel Convex Hull Algorithm for 2D points. <br/>

## ðŸ›  Building & Running for results

1. Run the below command in terminal. This should give the initial results as per the report

   ```sh
   ./script.sh
   ```

2. You can also play with the algorithm by changing<br />
    * Open the testing.cpp file
    * modify the input by giving the input into input.txt file
    * You can use different functions available in this API(check doxygen documentation provided by going into "html/index.html") to modify the code.
    * Then run following commands
    
      ```sh
      g++ testing.cpp
      ./a.out
      python3 new_visual.py
      ```
3. You can check the resulting output visualization as kirk.gif in the same directory.
